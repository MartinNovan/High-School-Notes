Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing because my family is interested in your Eden Valley Chalets. We saw your advertisement in the newspaper and we would like to know a bit more before we decide to book our holiday.

Could you tell us how many bedrooms the larger chalets for 4–6 people have? We would also like to know what kinds of water sports are possible on the nearby beach. Another question is how far the chalets are from the town with the medieval cathedral, shops, restaurants, theatres and cinemas.

We are planning our holiday either in early June or late August, so we would be grateful if you could also send us the prices for these times.

Thank you in advance for your reply.

Yours faithfully,  
Martin Novan
